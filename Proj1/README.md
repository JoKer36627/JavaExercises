This project contains two Java programs:

1. **Main**: Reads numbers from the keyboard until 0 is entered and calculates the sum of all entered numbers.
   Example: Input: 5, 3, 0 → Output: Sum of numbers: 8.0

2. **NumOfArm**: Checks if a given number is an Armstrong number (the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself).
   Example: Input: 153 → Output: 153 is an Armstrong number
