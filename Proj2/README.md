This project contains two Java programs using recursion to calculate the sum of digits:

1. **Main**: Reads a number from the keyboard and calculates the sum of its digits.  
   Example: Input: 507 → Output: 12

2. **SumOfNum**: Calculates the sum of digits of a predefined number.  
   Example: Input: 1234 → Output: 10
